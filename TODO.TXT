* (See "TODO" entries in the *.pas files)

KNOWN BUGS:
- If you fill a description with 255 characters, then save, then the last 4 are not getting written. why?
  ... actually, sometimes also just 1 char vanishes. maybe it was something to do with the amount of CRLF?

IDEAS:
* If you call OIDPLUS.EXE with an argument to a .OID file, then open this OID
* TreeView: Write to StringList (avoid recursive calls) and save StringList to file
* TreeView: In the preview, let the user jump to a specific OID
* Implement RAs
* Implement Create/Update timestamps? (people must be able to predate it)
* Data exchange between OIDplus for Win95 and OIDplus 2.0 ?
* XML Export to OID-Info.com
