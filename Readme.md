
OIDplus for MS-DOS
==================

This is a retro-coding product of OIDplus, written in TurboPascal, aiming for DOS.
It is just a small gimmick / fun-project and should not be used for productive use!
Please use [the official version of OIDplus](https://github.com/danielmarschall/oidplus)
